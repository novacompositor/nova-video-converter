# Nova Video Converter

Nova Video Converter is a powerful and lightweight tool designed specifically for those who demand maximum precision in video conversion. The application combines the simplicity of an intuitive interface with the professional capabilities of the FFmpeg engine.

## Key Features

### 1. Pinpoint File Sizing
The flagship feature of Nova is its intelligent bitrate calculation. You no longer need to guess which settings to apply. Simply specify the desired size of the output file (for example, 50 MB), and the program will automatically calculate the necessary parameters to ensure the result exactly meets your expectations. No more oversized files when uploading to platforms with strict size limits.

### 2. Cross-Platform Support
The application works wherever you prefer to work:
- **Windows**: Convenient installer (EXE) and seamless system integration.
- **macOS**: Native support, fully fully optimized for Apple Silicon processors (M1/M2/M3).
- **Linux**: Packages for all popular distributions (Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, Arch Linux).

### 3. Incredible Speed and Efficiency
- **Small Footprint**: The program takes up minimal disk space and does not overload your system with unnecessary background processes.
- **High Speed**: Optimized data transfer algorithms allow you to extract maximum performance from your processor.
- **All-Inclusive**: There is no need to manually install external codecs or FFmpeg on your system — everything you need is already built directly into the application.

### 4. Extensive Format Support
Nova supports virtually any input video format thanks to its integration with professional media libraries. You can import MP4, AVI, MKV, MOV, WEBM, and many others — the converter handles them flawlessly.

### 5. Professional Compression Modes
- **Standard Conversion**: Suitable for quick, everyday tasks.
- **Two-Pass Encoding (2-pass)**: The highly recommended mode for achieving the best possible quality for a strictly defined file size. The program first analyzes the video and then performs an optimal compression pass.

## Design and Usability
The application's interface features a modern, clean design with support for both dark and light themes. It is stripped of all distracting and unnecessary elements, leaving only intuitive controls. This is a tool built to simply do its job: quickly, accurately, and professionally.
